The data were taken from the Eberley College of Science page
 (Eberleigh Science College): 
By writing a data visualisation, we put forward and confirmed the hypothesis

 1. Young people taking short-term loans. 
2. people with no age division, who only take out long-term loans (more than two years). 
3. middle-aged people who take loans for one to three years.
 4. People of pre-retirement age who take out loans for up to two and a half years.
 5. Pensioners who take credit for up to three years.
